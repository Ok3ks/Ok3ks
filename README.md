Hi ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m Emmanuel Okedele. 

Iâ€™m currently enthused by the applications of Data science and Machine Learning especially in fields such as forecasting, text analytics and Natural Language Processing. 

However, utilising Data science and Machine learning is only a phase in the building of data products. Other phases such as data engineering and model deployment are equally important. The long-term goal is to have technical experience and overarching knowledge of phases involved in building data products.

In summary, I have skills in Data Analysis and Modelling, Machine Learning, Text Analysis,Natural Language Processing using tools like Python,SQL,and Cloud Platforms(GCP,AWS). I am currently upskilling in the field of Data Engineering.

I am a huge sports fan, and in my spare time I like to play around with sports data, read articles.

On the occasion that you need my attention, perhaps for a project or a role, you can reach me via my [email](okedeleayodeji60@outlook.com)
