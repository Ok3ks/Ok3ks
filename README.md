Hi ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m Ayodeji Emmanuel Okedele. I'm interested in Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning roles. My tool stack is Python, SQL, GCP. 

Projects I have worked on include: 

- Analysis of IMDB movie data to make recommendations for the next proposed movie for Sussex Budget with pandas (https://github.com/Ok3ks/IMDB_movie_metadata-analysis)
- Using Bias free Machine learning algorithms to predict loan repayment chance of individuals from features such as salary, credit history etc using XGBoost(https://github.com/Ok3ks/Bias_and_ML).
- Activity Prediction from Sensor Measurements of several subjects while performing different activities (https://github.com/Ok3ks/Activity_Prediction)
- Color detection of square blocks using image processing techniques such as noise removal,image registration, segmentation in MATLAB(https://github.com/Ok3ks/Image-Segmentation)

Iâ€™m currently enthused by the applications of Data science and Machine Learning especially in fields such as forecasting, Natural Language Processing. 

In my spare time, I watch sitcoms, football and read articles. On the occasion that you need my attention, perhaps for a project or a role, you can reach me via my [email](okedeleayodeji60@outlook.com)
