Hi ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m Emmanuel Okedele. I'm interested in Data Science, Data Engineering and Machine Learning roles. My tool stack is Python, SQL, GCP. 

Projects I have worked on include Data and Sentiment Analysis of IMDB movie data and comments, Document Classification using a variety of techniques.

Iâ€™m currently enthused by the applications of Data science and Machine Learning especially in fields such as forecasting, Natural Language Processing. 

In my spare time, I watch sitcoms, football and read articles. On the occasion that you need my attention, perhaps for a project or a role, you can reach me via my [email](okedeleayodeji60@outlook.com)
